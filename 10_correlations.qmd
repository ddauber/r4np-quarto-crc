# Correlations {#correlations}

Sometimes counting and measuring means, medians, and standard deviations is not enough because they are all based on a single variable. Instead, we might have questions related to the relationship of two or more variables. In this section, we will explore how correlations can (and kind of cannot - see Chapter \@ref(simpsons-paradox)) provide insights into the following questions:

-   Do movie viewers agree with movie critics regarding the rating of movies?

-   Do popular movies receive more votes from users than less popular movies?

-   Do movies with more votes also make more money?
