# Setting up *R* and RStudio {#setting-up-r-and-rstudio}

Every journey starts with gathering the right equipment. This intellectual journey is not much different. The first step that every *R* novice has to face is to set everything up to get started. There are essentially two strategies:

-   Install [*R*](https://www.r-project.org "R"){target="_blank"} and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com "RStudio"){target="_blank"}

or

-   Run RStudio in a browser via [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud "RStudio Cloud"){target="_blank"}

While installing *R* and RStudio requires more time and effort, I strongly recommend it, especially if you want to work offline or make good use of your computer's CPU. However, if you are unsure whether you enjoy learning *R*, you might wish to look at RStudio Cloud first. Either way, you can follow the examples of this book no matter which choice you make.

## Installing R {#installing-r}

The core module of our programming is *R* itself, and since it is an open-source project, it is available for free on Windows, Mac and Linux computers. So, here is what you need to do to install it properly on your computer of choice:

1.  Go to [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org%5D(https://www.r-project.org) "www.r-project.org"){target="_blank"}

2.  Click on `CRAN` where it says `Download`.

3.  Choose a server in your country (all of them work, but downloads will perform quicker if you choose your country or one that is close to where you are).

4.  Select the operating system for your computer, for example `Download R for macOS`.

5.  Select the version you want to install (I recommend the latest version)

6.  Open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions. I recommend leaving the suggested settings as they are.

This was relatively easy. You now have *R* installed. Technically you can start using *R* for your research, but there is one more tool I strongly advise installing: RStudio.
