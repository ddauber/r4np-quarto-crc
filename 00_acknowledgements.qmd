# Acknowledgements {#sec-acknowledgements .unnumbered .unlisted}

My deepest gratitude goes to my beloved wife, Fiona, who supported me in so many ways that I would not be able to list them all here. I am grateful for having you by my side. Also, I would like to thank my son Lukas and daughter Luna, who patiently watched me sitting at the computer typing this book and encouraged me with hugs, smiles and kisses. Finally, my mother-in-law, Ida, deserves special thanks because she ensured I would not starve while passionately completing this mammoth project.
