# R4NP Book to be published by Routledge Chapman & Hall/CRC books

This is the updated, but still work-in-progress, version of the book **R For Non-Programmers: A Guide for Social Scientists**.

The main difference to the current book will be updated content as well as the conversion from an RMarkdown to a Quarto book.
