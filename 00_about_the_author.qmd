# About the author {#about-the-author .unnumbered}

I am an Associate Professor at the University of Warwick. My research interfaces with multiple disciplines, such as International Management, Organisational Behaviour, Cross-cultural Psychology and Intercultural Communication. Most of my research investigates real-life issues in organisational contexts using a diagnostic angle with an emphasis to help improve organisational members' experiences and organisational performance.

For more than 13 years, I enjoy teaching students how to turn data into meaningful recommendations for businesses, universities and the broader society by conveying relevant theory-driven knowledge as well as research methods skills. In addition, I am enthusiastic about new approaches to analysing data, whether it is quantitative or qualitative.
