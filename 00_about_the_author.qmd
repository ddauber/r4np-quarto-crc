# About the author {#sec-about-the-author .unnumbered .unlisted}

I am a Reader[^00_about_the_author-1] at the University of Warwick. My research interfaces with multiple disciplines, such as International Management, Organisational Behaviour, Cross-cultural Psychology and Intercultural Communication. Most of my research investigates real-life issues in organisational contexts using a diagnostic angle with an emphasis on helping prove organisational members' experiences and organisational performance.

[^00_about_the_author-1]: A Reader is a senior academic position, a rank between Associate Professor and Full Professor.

For more than 15 years, I have enjoyed teaching students how to turn data into meaningful recommendations for businesses, universities and the broader society by conveying relevant theory-driven knowledge and research methods skills. In addition, I am enthusiastic about new approaches to analysing data, whether quantitative or qualitative.
