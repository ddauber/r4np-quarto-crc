# The RStudio Interface {#the-rstudio-interface}

The RStudio interface is composed of quadrants, each of which fulfils a unique purpose:

-   The `Console` window,

-   The `Source` window,

-   The `Environment / History / Connections / Tutorial` window, and

-   The `Files / Plots / Packages / Help / Viewer` window

Sometimes you might only see three windows and wonder where the `Source` window has gone in your version of RStudio. In order to use it you have to either open a file or create a new one. You can create a new file by selecting `File > New File > R Script` in the menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Shift + N` on PC and `Cmd + Shift + N` on Mac.

I will briefly explain the purpose of each window/pane and how they are relevant to your work in *R*.
